Steps to building a chrome app

1) Modify html tag (around line 2) of app.html so it includes overflow-y scroll: <html style="overflow-y: scroll">
2) Add all files from folder ChromeApp to project root folder
3) Use Chrome Extensions to build a package - that's the easiest way to package the app. Turn developer mode on and just go Settings > Extensions > Pack extension.
4) To publish app on Google store check out following link: https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish
