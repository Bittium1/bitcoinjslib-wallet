## Chrome Application Option for the HD Wallet
Here you can build a Chrome app version of the web wallet to share in the Chrome App store. We have excluded the zip files from the repo so you'll need to create those.

## Features
- Chrome Application Web based wallet
- Developer ready

## Building the Chrome App
1. Modify html tag (around line 2) of app.html so it includes overflow-y scroll: <html style="overflow-y: scroll">

2. Add all files from folder ChromeApp to project root folder

3. Use Chrome Extensions to build a package - that's the easiest way to package the app. Turn developer mode on and just go Settings > Extensions > Pack extension.

4. To publish app on Google store check out following link: https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish
